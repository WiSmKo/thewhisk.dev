                    <p>I’m Birmingham born and raised but I also have Indian & German heritage. Growing up with my Indian Oma, we would frequently recieve guests from all over the world and I was fortunate enough to get to visit many of them in return. Therefore, from a young age, I have had the oppurtunity to nurture my inquisitiveness from a global perspective. </p>
                    <p>I have been fascinated by computers for as long as I can remember, nagging my parents to teach me more than the school cirruculum had on offer and teaching myself what I could from free internet resources. On the other hand, I also have a great love for arts and music. My weekends as a teenager were spent at youth theare school. By the time I was reaching the end of my Diploma in Computing I was becoming quite involved with my local music scene, at the time they seemed like two completely different worlds that didn’t have much in common.</p>
                    <p>The last 5 years for me have laregly been defined by music, I have worked locally as a performer, band manager and event organiser. Having had the oppurtunity to play shows across the country and to contribute to a flourishing local scene I feel incredibly privaliged for the experiences I have been a part of. However as my need to promote music and events through digital means grew, my passion for technology and development was reignited. I went full circle, enthused by my two alternate universe’s coliding I have strived to stay on top of the constantly evolving world of development through online courses and kept my mind challenged with regular practice of maths and related subjects.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I like to keep active and read. Cycling, indoor climbing, fitness and nutrition were significant past times/interests for me in 2020. I make time to read everyday, I can’t get enough of a good book and the pile ‘to read’ grows faster than I can get through them. Currently I’m reading Tolstoy’s novel ‘Anna Karenina’ & the poplar science book ‘Why We Sleep’ by neuroscientist Matthew Walker.</p>
